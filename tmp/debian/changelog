xymon (4.3.0~beta2.dfsg-9.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Fix "FTBFS: PCRE not found": patch from Ubuntu / Steve Langasek:
    - debian/rules: pass --pcrelib to find libpcre in the multiarch dir
      LP: #749190.
    Additionally build-depend on dpkg-dev (>= 1.16.0) and
    libpcre3-dev (>= 8.12-4~). (Closes: #651231)
  * Since this Ubuntu patch, SSL and LDAP also went multiarch, so:
    - also pass --ssllib and --ldaplib to configure in debian/rules
    - build-depend on libssl-dev (>= 1.0.0e-1~) and libldap2-dev (>= 2.4.25-2~)
  * libpng also went multiarch, so build/rrd.sh doesn't find it, and there's
    no option for configure. Add patch png-multiarch that changes build/rrd.sh
    to use libpng12-config instead of guessing.
