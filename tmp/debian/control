Description: monitoring system for systems, networks and applications
 Xymon (previously called Hobbit) is a network- and applications-
 monitoring system designed for use in large-scale networks. But it will
 also work just fine on a small network with just a few nodes. It is
 low-overhead and high-performance, with an easy to use web front-end.
 .
 Network services are monitored remotely. Machine health and
 statistics are monitored through a locally installed client package
 (xymon-client). Additional (remote as well as local) checks are
 available in the package hobbit-plugins.
 .
 Alerts can trigger when monitoring detects a problem, resulting in
 e-mails or calls to your pager or mobile phone.
 .
 Xymon has a great deal of inspiration from the non-free Big Brother
 package, but does not include any Big Brother code.
